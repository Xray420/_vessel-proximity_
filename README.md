# _vessel-proximity_
"The primary goal of this project is to determine the number of containers that are located in close proximity to each other at any given moment."


To enhance efficiency, I've implemented data modifications that significantly reduce computational overhead. as we use for loop which will increase computation exponentially


Additional Suggestions:
                  - By adding more dynamic feature like specifying what is the minimum distance 
                  - By tracking containers that may pass near by location within the minimum timespan this will add more complication
                  - Try to plot in map mode for better visulization 

Any comments or suggestion are welcome.
